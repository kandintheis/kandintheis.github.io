          <p class="words">This page is not a blog, since I have no desire to consistently update a writing page, and neglected blogs make me sad. I use it instead to explain the "Photos" page of my website. <br><br>It is devoted to a subset of the photographs I have taken with 35mm film cameras. I do not protest to be an expert photographer; I consider myself more an experimental one. Sometimes it takes over a year for me to finish a roll, since I shy away from conventional subjects, as I would rather have a ruined exposure than a boring one. All of the images are significantly downsized, so please contact me by email if you would like more definition.
