            <h1>Mathematics</h1>

              <p>While I have respect for order and design, I also admire simplicty; and for a subject which prides itself in open assumptions, bare HTML is fitting. This page is clearly dedicated to my mathematical journey, which has been my primary object of study for the last two years. Although I do not have the maturity to state "research interests" yet, I can confidently say that I have grown to love mathematics for its effictive use of symbology, and not for its practicality. This is not to say that I detest applied mathematics, but only to say that I am better suited to material with does not concern itself with physical intuition. Where this will lead me, I do not know. I have for some time considered learning more about model theory and formal languages, since my knowledge of these subjects is largely confined to hours spent with archaic books from my university library. Linked below is my CV, which at this stage resembles more a template than a defense of my productivity.</p>
